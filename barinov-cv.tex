\section{Brief description}
\cvitem {} {My major activity -- C/C++ development on Linux-based platforms.\newline{} I really enjoy the OpenSource
  software and interaction with community and do my best to contribute to OpenSource projects which I'm interested in or
  have to deal with at day-time job.}
\section{Commercial Projects}
  \subsection{C/C++ / Linux}
  \cvitem {Tizen}
  {\url{https://tizen.org}\newline{}
    Tizen toolchain support and enhancement.\newline{}
    Our team is working on toolchain support and enhancement accordingly to requests of Samsung developers all over the
    world and own vision of perfect toolchain. We are the guys who created an ARM64~Tizen~3.0 in 2014 beginning
    and stabilized the OS even before first 64bit Android release.\newline{}
    Digging inside GCC and Binutils to find why stack trace tells lies to developers, debugging on-device soft using gdb
    through port forwarded using netcat over Wi-Fi because kernel is not finished and there is no other way to connect,
    finding a way to implement needed feature the right way instead of workaround in the limited time --
    that's about me.\newline{}
    Since I've lately been promoted to PM the task set widened with looking for appropriate customer for such experience
    and directing team members' fun into scope needed by commercial divisions. Two successfully completed projects say
    I'm not totally useless in this field as well.\newline{}
    Currently the third project is agreed and we start adding new features to GCC. Be ready for new sanitizers and PGO 
    methods in upstream.}
