\section{Brief description}
\cvitem {} {My major activity -- C/C++ development on Linux-based platforms now
  with more and more Rust involvement.\newline{} I really enjoy the OpenSource
  software and interaction with community and do my best to contribute to
  OpenSource projects which I'm interested in or have to deal with at day-time
  job.}
\section{Commercial Projects}
  \subsection{C/C++ for Linux/QNX}
  \cvitem {Arene OS}
  {\url{https://woven.toyota/en/arene/}\newline{}
    Arene OS toolchain support and enhancement.\newline{}
    We're working on different toolchains for the Arene OS development and
    their promotion among developers: different compilers, linkers, code
    analysis tools and providing the best and securest toolchain to develop the
    vehicle of the future.}
  \subsection{C/C++ / Linux}
  \cvitem {Tizen}
  {\url{https://tizen.org}\newline{}
    Tizen toolchain support and enhancement.\newline{}
    Our team has been working on toolchain support and enhancement accordingly to requests of Samsung developers all over the
    world and own vision of perfect toolchain. We were the guys who created an ARM64~Tizen~3.0 in the beginning of 2014
    and stabilized the OS even before first 64bit Android release, and started RISC-V version in 2023.\newline{}
    We prepared a fully-sanitized image of Tizen OS to check all the applications at once for testing purposes, and
    applied binary watermarking technology system-wide to get maximum from available tooling.\newline{}
    Digging inside GCC and Binutils to find why stack trace tells lies to developers, debugging on-device soft using gdb
    through port forwarded using netcat over Wi-Fi because kernel is not finished and there is no other way to connect,
    finding a way to implement needed feature the right way instead of workaround in the limited time--that's about me.
    \newline{}
    After promotion to project lead the task set widened with looking for appropriate customer for such experience
    and directing team members' fun into scope needed by commercial divisions. Ten years of successful projects say
    I'm useful in this field as well.\newline{}
    Our team was invoked into code analysis movement and I joined dynamic analysis forces to improve and promote sanitizers
    among Samsung. Now, as far as I know, we're the first team who performed full-system sanitization (not sure if someone
    tried that anyway).
