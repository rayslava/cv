\section{Brief description}
\cvitem {} {My major activity -- C/C++ development on Linux-based platforms.\newline{} I really enjoy the OpenSource
  software and interaction with community and do my best to contribute to OpenSource projects which I'm interested in or
  have to deal with at day-time job.}
\section{Commercial Projects}
  \subsection{C/C++ / Linux}
  \cvitem {Tizen}
  {\url{https://tizen.org}\newline{}
    Tizen toolchain support and enhancement.\newline{}
    Our team is working on toolchain support and enhancement accordingly to requests of Samsung developers all over the
    world and own vision of perfect toolchain. We are the guys who created an ARM64~Tizen~3.0 in the beginning of 2014
    and stabilized the OS even before first 64bit Android release.\newline{}
    Digging inside GCC and Binutils to find why stack trace tells lies to developers, debugging on-device soft using gdb
    through port forwarded using netcat over Wi-Fi because kernel is not finished and there is no other way to connect,
    finding a way to implement needed feature the right way instead of workaround in the limited time --
    that's about me.\newline{}
    After I've been promoted to PL the task set widened with looking for appropriate customer for such experience
    and directing team members' fun into scope needed by commercial divisions. Six years of successful projects say
    I'm not totally useless in this field as well.\newline{}
    Our team was invoked into code analysis movement and I joined dynamic analysis forces to improve and promote sanitizers
    among Samsung. Now, as far as I know, we're the first team who performed full-system sanitization (not sure if someone
    tried that anyway).
